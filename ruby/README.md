# Rubocop

This is a RuboCop configuration which can be used in Ruby on Rails projects.

## Usage

To include this you need to add `rubocop` gem to your project gemfile:
```
gem 'rubocop'
```

and place `.rubocop.yml` in your project main directory.
Then you can call `bundle install` and that's it.
